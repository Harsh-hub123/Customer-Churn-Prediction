Customer Churn Prediction
This project is a Customer Churn Prediction application that uses neural network to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving a bank. It leverages a neural network model to analyze various customer attributes and make predictions.

Features
Neural Network Model: Utilizes a deep learning model to predict customer churn based on historical data.
Interactive Streamlit App: Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting customer data and viewing predictions.
Data Preprocessing: Includes encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
Real-time Predictions: Displays churn probability and provides actionable insights based on the prediction.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for building the model and application.
TensorFlow/Keras: For creating and training the neural network model.
Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing tasks like encoding and scaling.
Pandas: For handling and manipulating data.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.12.5 or later
Required libraries (see requirements.txt)

Acknowledgements
TensorFlow/Keras for the deep learning framework.
Streamlit for creating the interactive web application.
Scikit-learn for preprocessing tools.
